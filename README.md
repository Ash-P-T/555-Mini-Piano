Mini Portable Piano - 
Hardware & PCB designDesigned and developed a 12-note diatonic scale organ based on the 555 Timer IC.
Utilizing precision resistors and capacitors to generate accurate musical notes.
The circuit is configured in astable mode, with each note corresponding to specific resistor values that control the frequency of the square wave output. 
The project features a LDO voltage regulator for 5V power supply, ensuring consistent performance even with battery voltage fluctuations. 
The square wave signal is amplified using an audio amplifier circuit and delivered through an integrated speaker. 
Key components include a 9V battery, LDO voltage regulation, 12 buttons (for note selection), audio amplification with transistor-based design, and a protective diode to safeguard against back EMF.
